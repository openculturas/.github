OpenCulturas is a <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> distribution built as a pre-configured platform for cultural-focused communities. 

The organization behind it is a like-named non-profit association (foundation process ongoing) with the objective to foster the digital empowerment of actors in the cultural field.

The platform includes the following:
<ul>
<li>people/group profiles, location profiles, events/dates, magazine articles - all infinitely interconnectable</li>
<li>filterable overviews for all types (locations on a map, calendar, profiles overview, magazine</li>
<li>category pages aggregate pre-filtered content</li>
<li>pre-filtered aggregated "related content" blocks, e. g. a calendar related to a location/profile, connections to band/ensemble profiles, mentioning magazine articles</li>
<li>hierarchically structured taxonomies like focus categories, accessibility features, trigger warnings</li>
<li>interaction options like bookmark links for individual watchlists, public recommendations</li>
<li>focus on user-generated content, with moderation workflows, abuse flags etc.</li>
</ul>

Based on repeating usability tests, there are even more features on the roadmap.

Dedicated website at <a href="https://www.openculturas.org/en">www.openculturas.org</a> coming soon.

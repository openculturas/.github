OpenCulturas is a <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> distribution built as a pre-configured platform for cultural-focused communities. 

The organization behind it is a like-named non-profit association (foundation process ongoing) with the objective to foster the digital empowerment of actors in the cultural field.

The platform includes the following:
<ul>
<li>people/group profiles, location profiles, events/dates, magazine articles - all infinitely interconnectable</li>
<li>filterable overviews for all types (locations on a map, calendar, profiles overview, magazine</li>
<li>category pages aggregate pre-filtered content</li>
<li>pre-filtered aggregated "related content" blocks, e. g. a calendar related to a location/profile, connections to band/ensemble profiles, mentioning magazine articles</li>
<li>hierarchically structured taxonomies like focus categories, accessibility features, trigger warnings</li>
<li>interaction options like bookmark links for individual watchlists, public recommendations</li>
<li>focus on user-generated content, with moderation workflows, abuse flags etc.</li>
</ul>

Based on repeating usability tests, there are even more features on the roadmap.

## Technology

OpenCulturas is a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/3321602">Drupal distribution</a>, i. e. a Drupal core system with quite some well-established contributed modules, an established contributed back-end theme. On top there's a custom front-end theme and a bit of custom code that was necessary for the distribution. We follow coding standards and contribute wherever useful + possible.

External dependencies (for example, <a href="/openstreetmap">OpenStreetMap</a> or <a href="/dynamicweb/swiffy-slider">Swiffy Slider</a>) are managed by dedicated modules, using composer. 

## How to contribute

For the time being we prefer the well-established <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/openculturas">issue queue on Drupal.org</a>. We are working on low-threshold processes to get you on board. 

Feel free to discuss your contribution ideas with the OpenCulturas team: Please visit <a href="https://www.openculturas.org/en/calendar">the OpenCulturas event calendar</a> to find a suitable "Dojo" date which is a regular cost-free online meeting, using BigBlueButton.
